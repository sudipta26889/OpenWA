 * whatsapp-web.js applies a pin by answering the page's document request from its request
 * interceptor, so the pin holds only for a page load that goes through it. WhatsApp Web's service
 * worker can answer the document from its own cache without the request ever reaching the
 * interceptor, and a pin whose HTML could not be fetched installs no interceptor at all (the
 * library's remote cache is non-strict and falls back to the live build). Either way the startup
 * line `Pinning WhatsApp Web version …` still names the pin, and nothing read back the build that
 * actually booted, so a session reported to be on one build could be running another.
 *
 * The comparison is on the numeric build only (see {@link numericBuild}). A pin that does not parse
 * as one cannot be compared, and gets the info line rather than a warning. A read that fails or
 * answers nothing usable stays silent: a page that died mid-read, or one without `window.Debug`,
 * says nothing about which build is running.
 *
 * Deliberately advisory, like the call-hook check it sits next to: it never changes the session's
 * status, and the caller does not await it.
