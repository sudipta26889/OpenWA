  /**
   * Backfill chat/contact display names after connect. Baileys 6.7.x often skips the initial app-state

   * names never arrive. Fetch group subjects (reliable) and best-effort re-trigger the app-state sync;
   * both are non-fatal, and DM push-names still arrive via `contacts.update` on live messages.
   *
   * On a reconnect (`accountSyncCounter > 0`) Baileys skips history sync and the address-book snapshot
   * entirely: WhatsApp assumes the linked device kept its local copy. This gateway's contact store is
   * in-memory, so a process restart leaves GET /contacts empty. Once per engine instance we therefore drop
   * the stored version of the contact collection (so the next resync asks for a snapshot, not an
   * incremental patch) and process its mutations as an initial sync, which is what emits
   * `contacts.upsert` for the saved address book. The other collections keep the incremental resync
   * below.
   *
   * Once per engine instance, not "only when no saved contact is held": during the initial sync the event
   * buffer folds an app-state `contacts.upsert` into a `messaging-history.set` record it is already
   * holding for that id (`absorbed contact upsert in contact set` in Baileys' event-buffer), and the
   * whole initial sync is buffered as one batch, so those saved names arrive only inside the history
   * event, where the handler strips `name` because a history name is a chat title. The address book
   * is then PARTIAL rather than empty, and a count-based gate reads partial as "nothing to do" and
   * never repairs it. The snapshot pull is the only source that cannot be absorbed, so it runs on its
   * own schedule instead of on a count.
   *
   * A first link opens with the counter still at 0, so this method skips the pull there; the
   * lifecycle pulls once the initial history sync has gone quiet instead (see
   * BaileysLifecycle.scheduleAddressbookRestore). That pull does not count as this instance's one, so
   * a first reconnect still repairs whatever a late history chunk absorbed again.
