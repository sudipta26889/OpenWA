 * of that object, so the bare form produces exactly this one. The base guard instead reads
 * `THROTTLER:SKIP` + the name of each CONFIGURED tier, and this application names its tiers `short`,

 * Rate-limit bucket keyed on the resolved client IP.

 * The stock ThrottlerGuard keys on `req.ip`, which — behind the documented reverse
 * proxy with Express `trust proxy` disabled — resolves to the proxy for every client,
 * so all traffic shares ONE bucket and a single abuser rate-limits everyone (self-DoS).
 *
 * This reuses the same trusted-proxy-aware resolution as ApiKeyGuard: with no
 * TRUSTED_PROXIES configured it falls back to the socket IP (no behavior change and no
 * XFF-spoofing risk); with trusted proxies it keys on the real forwarded client IP.
 *
 * The resolved address is normalized through `@nestjs/throttler`'s `normalizeIp`:
 * IPv6 addresses are masked to `ipv6SubnetPrefix` (default /64) so that an IPv6 client
 * cannot evade rate limits by rotating addresses within its subnet, while IPv4,
 * IPv4-mapped, and loopback addresses remain unchanged.
