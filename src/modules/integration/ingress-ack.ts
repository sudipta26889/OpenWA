 *    host frames the ack itself and never compresses it, so a declared `Content-Encoding: gzip`
 *    describes bytes the ack does not carry and the provider's client fails to decode it, while a
 *    declared `Transfer-Encoding` makes Node re-frame a body it has already given a length, and a
 *    declared `Trailer` makes it refuse to write the response at all. `content-length` is inert,
 *    Express overwrites it, and is fenced with the rest rather than reasoned about separately;
 *  - the browser-facing protections that make a reflected ack body safe in the first place.
