 *   `messages[]`). An optional `?chatId=` does not qualify — the guard would have nothing to check
 *   when it is omitted.
 * - `'filtered'` — lists chats instead of naming one, and filters the result through
 *   ChatScopeService.
 * - `'agnostic'` — names no chat and cannot reach one, so the mark itself is the assertion. This is
 *   the one category the structural coverage spec cannot derive (a webhook with `events: ['*']` also
 *   names no chat), so every `'agnostic'` grant must also be listed in the spec's AGNOSTIC_GRANTS.
