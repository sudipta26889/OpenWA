/**
 * Make a failed whatsapp-web.js send report what the page actually threw.
 *
 * `Client.sendMessage` runs the send inside `page.evaluate`, and puppeteer rebuilds a page-side
 * exception in Node from two CDP fields only, the class name and the description
 * (puppeteer-core `cdp/utils.js` `createEvaluationError`). WhatsApp Web's own error classes are
 * minified to a one-letter name and keep their detail in their own properties rather than in
 * `message`, so a send the page refuses (`MediaFileTooLarge`, `InvalidMediaCheckRepairFailedType`)
 * reaches OpenWA as `t: t` with nothing but Node frames. The warning a failed send logs then names
 * no cause, and neither does anything the operator can send upstream (#1679).
 *
 * The patch wraps the one `window.WWebJS.sendMessage` call inside that evaluate. A plain Error is
 * rethrown untouched, for the reasons given at FIX. Any other thrown value is rethrown as a plain
 * Error whose message is PREFIX followed by a JSON summary read inside the page: the WhatsApp Web
 * build that is actually running, the constructor name, `String()`, `name`, `message`, `stack`, and
 * the value's own properties. The build is read from the page because the one OpenWA pins is not
 * always the one that runs: a warm profile's service worker can serve a newer build under the pin.
 *
 * Diagnostic only. A send that succeeds returns exactly what it returned before, and a send that
 * fails still fails; only the text of the failure changes. `getChat`, `sendSeen` and
 * `getMessageModel` stay outside the wrap, so their failures reach Node exactly as before.
 *
 * PREFIX is shared with `src/engine/adapters/wwebjs-lifecycle.ts` (CAPTURED_PAGE_ERROR_PREFIX),
 * whose dead-page classifier must never read a captured error as a transport death: the summary
 * quotes WhatsApp Web's own text, which can mention a closed connection while the page is plainly
 * alive. `wwebjs-send-page-error.spec.ts` pins the two constants equal.
 *
 * The source transform is deliberately exact and self-disabling, like the sibling patchers. An
 * unknown shape fails the production image build instead of silently shipping without it, and the
 * patch stands down once the installed tree carries it.

// A plain Error (`e.constructor === Error`) passes through as the SAME object. That is what the send
// path's readable failures already are: whatsapp-web.js's own throws (`Could not get the quoted
// message.`, `media-fault: ...`) and WhatsApp Web's bare `No LID for user`, which puppeteer rebuilds
// readably, message and page frames included. OpenWA matches them by substring
// (isNoLidForUserError, isQuoteUnresolvedError) and the dead-page classifier reads the same text, so
// handing them over byte-identical is what guarantees none of those decisions can change.
// Everything else is captured: WhatsApp Web's own subclasses, which arrive as `t: t`; primitives,
// which arrive as a bare value with no stack; objects puppeteer cannot describe (a null prototype, a
// hostile Proxy), which arrive as `Protocol error (Runtime.callFunctionOn): Internal error` and so
// read as a dead page; and native subclasses such as TypeError, which arrive readable today and gain
// the running build and their own properties.
//
// Every read of the thrown value is guarded, because it can be anything: a primitive, `undefined`, a
// null-prototype object, a throwing getter, a Proxy whose traps throw, or a cycle. Each field is cut
// to 500 characters and every field and property name shares a 2000-character budget, so a thrown
// object carrying a large buffer or thousands of properties cannot turn one failed send into a
// multi-kilobyte log line, bulk result or hook payload. The budget is charged in what the JSON
// spends, not in raw characters: escaping writes a control character as six, and each property
// adds its quotes, colon and comma, so counting the raw text let the message reach several times
// the budget.
